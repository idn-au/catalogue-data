    dcterms:description """The Mayi Kuwayu Study looks at how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing is linked to things like connection to country, cultural practices, spirituality and language use.
Our research team follows a large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and asks about their culture and wellbeing. As a longitudinal study, we are surveying people and then ask them to take the same survey every few years, so that we can understand what influences changes over time.
This is the first time a national study of this type has been done and will provide an evidence base to allow for the creation of better policies and programs.
This study has been created by and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander controlled research resource.
The Mayi Kuwayu team are experienced at working closely with communities across Australia, and the study has majority Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staffing and study governance (decision making) structure.""" ;
