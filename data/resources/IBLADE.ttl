    ex:notes """The report describes the building of an I-BLADE dataset. Alot of linkage work has been done across various business registries. Cannot find any public trace of the actual dataset? Why not? Is there a data management plan? Marcia's name is on this report.

Very interesting case as a depth study, geospatial potential.
