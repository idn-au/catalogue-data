    dcterms:description """The Composite Gazetteer of Australia is a cloud-based system allowing users to easily discover, interrogate and download place names information from Australia and its external territories. It is developed as a partnership between contributing agencies of the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping (ICSM) and is built on modern infrastructure providing automated ingestion and validation, producing a composite dataset from the individual jurisdictional gazetteers.

The place names database is a collection of jurisdictional data that is combined to create the Composite Gazetteer of Australia. Place name information is managed at a local level by jurisdictions. The place name database and the Composite Gazetteer of Australia are maintained by ICSM.""" ;
