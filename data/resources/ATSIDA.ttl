        """Issue with ADA/ATSIDA of how to design in catalog interoperability and leverage of existing metadata. ATSIDA at UTS does not appear to be well maintained (broken links, only one new deposit in recent years etc. Check with Kirsten about ongoing status).

The issue of catalog interoperability arises for ALL university data catalogs (where "Indigenous" content is involved.

This issue needs some serious analysis.""" ,
