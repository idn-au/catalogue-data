    dcterms:description """"Census indigenous community profiles" a CORE set of data produced by ABS various levels of abstraction:
All the EC's (Empowered Communities) would need access to this. Could be an excellent indigenous geospatial/loc-i case study for the the project's Geospatial portal e.g. semantic description of these profiles in a manner which enables easier access to data by EC data groups.First step would be to express EC boundaries in loc-i compatible ways.

e.g. https://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/communityprofile/216?opendocument

See 1991 collection at ATSIDA where there are 52 distinct entries in their data catalog - it's the same data for differing geospatial extents: https://www.atsida.edu.au/archive/search/subject/atsic-community-profile
It is desirable that our catalog represent the semantics correctly i.e. its a series with multiple temporal and geospatial extents.
